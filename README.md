# clean-ocr
Open image -> draw over zone of interest (drag&drop) -> get text.

Sometimes you just don't need to scan the whole image. </br>
And cut it into another file is a bit annoying. </br>
So use this script. </br>

## Download the whole project and then:
```pip install requirements.txt```

ESCAPE KEY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-> close </br>
ENTER KEY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-> get text from selected area </br>
BACKSPACE KEY  &nbsp; -> start again</br>
